üéûÔ∏è Cin√©on 
:The name Cin√©on comes from the ancient root ‚Äúkinein‚Äù ‚Äî to move.
Cinema began with motion; Cin√©on keeps that idea alive in code.
It‚Äôs built on movement, clarity, and modularity ‚Äî the same qualities that make great storytelling timeless.

A modular Node.js backend built for storytelling at scale.

Overview

Cin√©on is a structured, expressive backend for a modern video-sharing platform. Built on Node.js and Express, it follows a clean architectural rhythm ‚Äî controllers for logic, models for data, and declarative routes for clarity. Every piece fits together so developers can expand features without breaking flow.

Cin√©on handles video, user, playlist, like, subscription, tweet, and comment modules, each with consistent error handling and response standards. Media management runs through Cloudinary, while authentication, uploads, and async control are handled with lightweight middlewares.
